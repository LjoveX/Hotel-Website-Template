        <h2><span class="text-primary">History</span> of KTB Hotel</h2>
        <p>
          Our hotel was born in 1964, it's one of the oldest in town. Originally
          it was a house of a factory worked, he used to live here with his
          family. During the 50s and the roaring years, he decide to move in a
          bigger home near the center of the city. For that, in his memory we
          decide to leave untouched the structure of the rooms, we just renewed
          the furnitures and the bathrooms, to let you live a full experience of
          the 40s but without forgiving all the comforts of the modern era.
